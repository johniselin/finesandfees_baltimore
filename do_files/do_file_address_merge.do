This do-file takes cleaned data from prior do-files, and (when possible) maps 
addresses to neighborhoods, and then neighborhoods to city CSA neighborhoods, 
about which we have Census demographics. 

We do not have enough information to merge data on towing, parking, 

Towing -> 29.57 percent of our data can be merged
Parking -> 11.48 percent of our data can be merged

* Create neighborhood dta file
clear

*ECB Citations - Has city neighborhood data already included

use "data_cleaned/ecb_citations_cleaned.dta", clear

* For Vacant Lots And Arrests

}


* For vacant_lots and ecb_citations use neighborhood designation
* from address match derived from property tax data to matched neighbor-
* hood (small) to neighborhood (large) to merge with census data.
